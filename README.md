# Sketch Date Exporter

#### When creating multiple versions of a design it was really hard for me to track the changes, so I saved them in different folders organised by date, than replacing the dates either renaming the folder or the artboard names was exhausting, so I decided to create a plugin for that. What it actually does is to export any selected artboards and replacing the word 'DATE' with today's date. This plugin was created for my personal use, if you can find a use in it, enjoy.

### Usage Example:
Let's say you have multiple artboards and old or new versions named:
```bash
/Screens/Green/English/2022-01-05/screen_01
```
replace the date with 'DATE' string and export them using the plugin, the 'DATE' string will be automatically replaced by today's date, to:
```bash
/Screens/Green/English/DATE/screen_01 -> /Screens/Green/English/2022-01-05/screen_01
```

### This plugin was created using Flat Export plugin which you can download in [here](https://github.com/TheSonOfThomp/sketch-flat-export)
